# FindTheMonkey
This learning script focuses on implementing useRef() in reactThree/fiber. Feel free to fork and play with it. Feedback is always welcome.

The script creates 9 instances of the Coconut components. In one of the coconuts, a cube is added. Click on the coconut to open it and check if the monkey is in it.

The Coconut component was created using npx GLTFJSX convertor. 

Future improvements: 
- adding a Game summary panel to display the user score
- add a button to start a new game without refreshing the page
